## 🔥 Introduction  

To address the trade-off between noisy full-graph modeling and information loss in simplified graphs, we propose a **Progressive Multi-View Graph Distillation paradigm (PMVGD)** for health event prediction.  

Specifically, we construct multi-view graphs from EHR and adopt a progressive teacher–student learning process to integrate complementary clinical signals.

1. **Phase 1: Teacher Encoder Pretraining**  
    Pretrain the teacher on the disease graph to learn robust clinical patterns.

2. **Phase 2: Multi-View Graph Collaborative Learning**  
   Train student encoders on procedure and medication graphs under teacher guidance.

3. **Phase 3: Adaptive Sequential Distillation**  
   Distill multi-view knowledge back into the teacher for refined prediction.

Altogether, PMVGD converts distillation from a static, one-shot compression into an iterative cycle of mutual refinement.

## 🚀 How to Run (Phase 1)

You can pretrain the **teacher encoder** on MIMIC-III using: 
```bash
python -m experiments.run_phase1 \
  --dataset mimic3 \
  --model teacher \
  --epoch_main 130 \
  --mimic3_path "PATH/TO/mimic3/hosp"
```
You can pretrain the **teacher encoder** on MIMIC-IV using: 
```bash
python -m experiments.run_phase1 \
  --dataset mimic4 \
  --model teacher \
  --epoch_main 70 \
  --mimic3_path "PATH/TO/mimic4/hosp"
```

> *Default checkpoints will be saved in `./ckpt/phase1/`.*
